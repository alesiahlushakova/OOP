1.	Licenses. In this Agreement, "Software" shall mean the machine readable LizardTech commercial software program(s) You received, including any associated files, modified versions, upgrades or other copies of such programs and files, and any associated media and printed materials. You may not modify, reverse engineer, disassemble or decompile, or otherwise seek to discover the source code of the Software. You may not rent, sublicense, or otherwise provide unlicensed third parties access to any version(s) of the Software or Related Materials, or Your rights under this Agreement. You may permanently transfer all of Your rights under this Agreement only after You receive written authorization from LizardTech.

If the Software is a browser plug-in for viewing MrSID or DjVu format files via a standard web browser ("Plug-in") that is deployed via a manual installer, You are permitted to copy and redistribute said manually-installed Plug-in Software, as provided herein. If You are unsure whether the Software is a manually-installed Plug-in, contact LizardTech at licensing@lizardtech.com. Otherwise, You may make only one (1) nonproductive backup copy of the Software. In the event of any such permissible copying of Software Your copy must include all the intact files that came with the Software, including without limitation the installer. If Your copy is stored on any form of tangible media, You must affix a permanent label stating:

This Software is property of LizardTech, Inc. Copyright (c) 2005, LizardTech, Inc., 1008 Western Ave., Suite 200, Seattle, WA 98104. All rights reserved. Use permitted only under license from LizardTech, Inc.

If the Software requires that You initially contact LizardTech for a specific key code before it will operate, You are permitted to move the Software from the CPU onto which You initially install it, to another CPU, only one (1) time per year without incurring any additional charges from LizardTech. Thereafter, each time You contact LizardTech requesting a key code You will incur LizardTech's then-current service and handling charge.

	1.1	Scope of Permitted Use for GeoExpress and Document Express Software. You have the nonexclusive, nontransferable right to install and use the GeoExpress or Document Express Software on a single central processing unit for Your own, internal use only.

	1.2	Scope of Permitted Use for LizardTech Express Server (LTES) Software. You have the nonexclusive, nontransferable right to install and use the LTES Software on one (1) central processing unit (CPU) or one (1) server, for Your own use, to support users accessing the Software via an internal network (e.g. intranet) or via the Internet, or other external network (i.e. to support Website content). The number of users using a single CPU that You may permit to access the Software for the purposes, or in the workflow, described herein, is determined by the number of Concurrent Access Licenses ("CALs") You have purchased from LizardTech, as provided below. In addition, and notwithstanding the number of CALs You have purchased, You have the non-exclusive, nontransferable right to install and use the Software on one (1) CPU for Your internal development use (e.g., for testing or a "mirror site" that is not used to support an intranet or Internet application or workflow, or any productive purposes) and for nonproductive purposes.

	(a) Use of Express Server SDK, Including Sample Source Code. The Software includes a Software Developer's Toolkit (including sample source code), the Express Server SDK ("SDK"), which permits You to customize the Software for Your own use. This subsection contains additional license provisions that apply to the SDK. Notwithstanding the number of CALs You have purchased, You have the royalty-free, non-exclusive, nontransferable right to install and use the SDK for internal development purposes only, on up to ten (10) CPU's in Your own facilities, but these development installations cannot support any intranet or Internet application or workflow, or otherwise be used for any productive purposes. You may not subcontract development use of the SDK unless the subcontractor(s) agree in writing to abide by the provisions of this Agreement. You may not modify, reverse engineer, disassemble or decompile, or otherwise seek to discover the source code of the SDK, except those portions of the SDK delivered to You as source code.

If You develop a custom application through the use of the SDK, that application may be installed and used in lieu of or in connection with the standard Software, but may not be used in addition, and independently to, the standard Software. Use of the Software both (i) as packaged in unmodified form (i.e. the standard Software), and (ii) as any custom application developed by You through the use of the SDK, counts against Your permitted one (1) CPU or server installation, and must be supported by corresponding CALs. Without limitation, You may not deploy a custom application developed through the use of the SDK concurrently with the standard Software unless the two operate as a single application, and said operation is otherwise consistent with the terms of this Agreement.

In no case may You distribute either the SDK or any custom application You (or Your subcontractor, if applicable) develop through its use, to third persons. Redistribution of any source code is expressly prohibited. Subject to the license You are granted in this Agreement, LizardTech retains all right title and interest in the SDK. However, You may claim copyright ownership in any macros, scripts, or other computer code authored by You that adds additional functionality to the SDK.

Except as permitted in this Agreement, You are not granted the right to prepare, and are expressly prohibited from preparing, any Derivative Works based on the Software. For purposes of this Agreement, "Derivative Work" means a work which is based upon one or more preexisting works, and which is a revision, modification, translation, abridgment, condensation, expansion, collection, compilation, or any other form in which such preexisting works may be recast, transformed, or adapted, and which, if prepared without authorization by the owner of a preexisting work, would constitute a copyright infringement under applicable law. If You would like to distribute an application developed using the SDK, or that incorporates all or a portion of the SDK, contact LizardTech at buspartners@lizardtech.com for information on how to procure the necessary license rights.

	(b) Use of auto-installer for MrSID or DjVu Plug-in. The Software contains auto-installers ("auto installers") for the MrSID and DjVu Plug-ins which permit users who access the Software to download Plug-ins. You may elect to disable this capability of the Software, at its option. If You opt to permit/enable auto-installer distribution of the Plug-ins, You may not modify, alter, or otherwise interfere with the operation of the auto-installer. You are not granted any distribution rights for the Plug-ins, except as enabled by the normal and intended operation of the auto-installer. Without limiting the foregoing, under no circumstance are You permitted to distribute software libraries identified as MrSIDI.cab, MrSID_BPI.cab, MrSIDI.jar, MrSIDI.OCX or DjVuControl.cab.

	(c) Bug Fixes. To the extent possible without violating this Agreement, You may fix bugs, if any, in the Software, provided that: (i) You immediately inform LizardTech of any such bug fixes and supply LizardTech with a copy of all computer programs (in source code form) relating to such bug fixes, and (ii) LizardTech owns all rights, title and interest in and to such bug fixes. You agree to assign to LizardTech all rights, title and interest in and to such bug fixes and any intellectual property rights pertaining thereto.

	(d) Concurrent Access Licenses (CALs). CALs are licenses You purchase that permit a quantity of users to access the Software at the same time. You must purchase a number of CALs corresponding to the maximum number of users permitted to access the Software simultaneously. For example, if You use the Software on an intranet accessed by a maximum of twenty-five (25) users at the same time, You need to purchase twenty-five (25) CALs. For questions regarding CALs, contact Your LizardTech sales representative or email LizardTech at licensing@lizardtech.com.

With Your purchase of the Software, You receive ten (10) CALs. If You require more CALs, You may purchase them from LizardTech.

	1.3	Data and Page Cartridges. This Software may employ Data or Page Cartridges ("Cartridges"). Cartridges work in conjunction with specific GeoExpress or Document Express Software previously installed on a user's system.  Cartridges may be installed on a single central processing unit or on a network server that permits access by as many users as You have purchased Software licenses. If the Software employs Cartridges: (i) the portion of the Software that enables Cartridges is licensed under this Agreement as part of the Software to which it applies, and the license conveyed herein with regard to Your use of the Software (and, as applicable, its corresponding Cartridge or Cartridges) is cumulative; (ii) You are expressly prohibited from attempting to separate a Cartridge from its corresponding Software, or from running these components separately.

2.	Proprietary Rights. LizardTech and/or its suppliers own the Software and You acknowledge that the structure, organization, and/or code to the Software is/are the valuable trade secret(s) of LizardTech and is/are protected by United States Copyright Law and International Treaty provisions.

See 37 CFR 401.6.

(d) LizardTech maintains a discount program for sales of software products incorporating the licensed technology to the U.S. Government, or any agency thereof, or any U.S. Government contractor who certifies that its purchase of such software is for, or on behalf of, the U.S. Government.

(e) The University may assign its rights in its License with LizardTech.

(f) Should LizardTech's rights in the MrSID Technology under its license with the University for any reason terminate during the term of this Agreement, such event will automatically operate as an assignment by LizardTech to the University of all LizardTech's rights, title, and interest in this Agreement. In such case, if You are not in default of the terms and conditions herein, You may continue to use the Software under the terms of this Agreement. All provisions for the protection of LizardTech would then protect the University.
